content='The course is taught on <b>WEDNESDAYS, 9am-5pm in room 2.19</b>. The topics to be covered are: <blockquote> <b>Week 1:</b> Supervised learning, linear models, gradient descent, experimental methods.<br> <b>Week 2:</b> Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbour methods.<br> <b>Week 3:</b> Decision Trees, ROC analysis.<br> <b>Week 4:</b> Probabilistic models, Bayes Theorem.<br> <b>Week 5:</b> Ensemble Methods, Feature Selection.<br> <b>Week 6:</b> Independent project work </blockquote> The structure of each weeks session will be approximately: <blockquote> <i>0900-0930</i>: Discussion of previous weeks material, with demonstrators present.<br> <i>0930-1000</i>: Unassessed multiple choice quiz on the previous week.<br> <i>1000-1230</i>: New lecture material (with appropriate breaks)<br> <i>1230-1330</i>: Lunch<br> <i>1330-1700</i>: Lab session (with demonstrators present) </blockquote> The course text (provided in class) should be your main reference material. Associated with each week is a reading assignment. The unassessed MCQ will test this material, as well as the material from the previous week.<br><br> <table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse" border="1" cellpadding="5" width="90%"> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Week</b></td> <td><b>Taught in-class</b></td><td><b>Homework</b></td> <td><b>Slides</b></td> </tr> <tr><td>1 (Wednesday 30th Sep)</td> <td>Ch 1+2</td><td>Ch 3</td> <td> <a href="./materials/Day1-session1.pdf">Basics of Linear Models</a><br> <a href="./materials/Day1-session2.pdf">Logistic Regression + Gradient Descent</a> </td> </tr> <tr><td>2 (Wednesday 7th Oct)</td> <td>Ch 4</td><td>Ch 5</td> <td> <a href="./materials/Day2-svm-session1.pdf">Basics of linear SVMs</a><br> <a href="./materials/Day2-svm-session2.pdf">SVMs + Non-linear kernels</a> </td> </tr> <tr><td>3 (Wednesday 14th Oct)</td> <td>Ch 6</td><td>Ch 7</td> <td> <a href="./materials/Day3-trees.pdf">Decision Trees</a><br> </td> </tr> <tr><td>4 (Wednesday 21st Oct)</td> <td>Ch 8</td><td>Project (interim deadline)</td> <td> <a href="./materials/Day4-BayesTheorem.pdf">Bayes Theorem</a><br> <a href="./materials/Day4-BayesNets.pdf">Bayesian Nets</a><br><br><br> Now see also the <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/bayes_nets/">Bayes Net tool</a> developed by one of my former students! </td> </tr> <tr><td>5 (Wednesday 28th Oct)</td> <td>Ch 9+10</td><td>Project</td> <td> <a href="./materials/Day5-Ensembles.pdf">Ensemble Methods</a><br><br> Guest Lecture by Sarah Noguiera:<br> <a href="./materials/slides/featureSelection.pdf">Introduction to Feature Selection</a><br><br> Additional (non-assessed) research talk: Nikolaos Nikolaou, <i>Cost Sensitivity in Boosting Algorithms</i>. </td> </tr> <tr><td>6 (Wednesday 4th Nov)</td> <td>-</td><td> Project deadline.<br> <b>MSc students: 6th Nov (FRIDAY) 4pm.</b><br> <b>CDT students: 13th Nov (FRIDAY) 4pm.</b><br> </td> <td> - </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <hr>'
